Guide of the Guide of the Program:

Words in [] means they can be typed with exact wording.
For example: /test [0|1|2] means you can type either /test or /test 0 or /test 1 or /test 2. 

Words in {} means they are parameters.
For exmaple: /test {integer} means you can type an integer behind /test, like /test -13 or /test 10000.

Note:
Integer: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
Long Long: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

-----Basic Commands-----
    {input}                 Inputs data to the system. 
                            Note: It will not be immediately flushed to the target file.
    ;{format}               Changes the format of the data.
                            Leaving {format} blank equals no format. 
                            For exmaple: ;C10 will automatically add "C10" in front of the input.
                            Adding a '*' character into the format will cause the format to be splitted.
                            For exmaple: ;3*.01 will automatically add "3" in front of the input and add ".01" after the input.
                            Default format is "".
    END                     Exits the program.
                            Note: All characters must be capitalized.
                            NOTE: ALL UNSAVED INPUTS WILL BE ERADICATED, PLEASE SAVE BEFORE YOU EXIT THE PROGRAM.
    /help [basic|advanced]  Opens this text.
    /save {fileLocation}    Saves the input to target file location. 
                            Leaving the fileLocation blank will save to the last specified file location.
                            Default fileLocation is PLEASE_TYPE_A_FILENAME_BEFORE_YOUR_FIRST_SAVE.
                            Inputing only filename will save in current folder.
                            You may use ../ in front of the filename to save to upper directories.
                            You may also do {foldername}/{filename} to save to lower directories.
                            You may also specify the exact file location.
                            Note: It is recommended to experiment these stuff by yourself.
                            Note: You don't have to input .txt when saving.
                            NOTE: SAVE COMMAND CANNOT BE UNDONE. PLEASE CONFIRM TWICE TO SEE IF YOU FILENAME IS CORRECT.
    /limit {integer}        Changes the buffer limit of the program.
                            This reduces the losses of your data when the program is crashed or errors are occured.
                            Default value is 50.
                            NOTE: SETTING LIMIT NOT GREATER THAN 0 WILL BLOCK ANY INPUT.
    /del {integer}          Deletes input.
                            Leaving integer blank will automatically delete last input.
                            You may specify a certain position of input. 
                            Negative integers will delete nth last input.
                            Positive integers will delete nth input.
                            Supports undo command.
                            Note: Flushed inputs (or saved inputs) is irrecoverable.
                            Note: Position is zero-based, meaning the index of the first element is 0.
                            NOTE: INPUTING AN INTEGER LARGER THAN THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS IN THE SYSTEM WILL CAUSE ERROR, AND UNEXPECTED ERRORS MAY OCCUR.
    /undo                   Undo last delete operation.
                            Only support undoing delete function.
    /redo                   (will be implemented later)
    /count {fileLocation}   Counts the number of inputs in the file.
                            You don't have to type ".txt" at the back of the filename.
                            The function will automatically quit when the time limit is exceeded or it reaches end of file character.
                            Default time limit is 2 seconds.
    /check {filelocation}   Checks if the input in the specified file is valid in a pre-defined booklist.
                            You don't have to type ".txt" at thr back of the filename.
                            It checks the last save file if the filelocation is not specified.
                            It returns the book code with the position of the book in the booklist, or returns "not found" if it is not in the booklist.
                            Default flie location is "booklist.txt".
                            Default time limit is 6 seconds.



-----Advanced Commands-----
    /clear                  Clears the undo stack, which may run faster after clearing the stack.
    /reload {filelocation}  Manually load a booklist to the program.
                            Note: A specfied filelocation is REQUIRED in order to work.
                            NOTE: RELOAD FUNCTION WILL CLEAR ALL THE BOOKS LOADED IN THE PROGRAM BEFORE, AND LOAD THE ONES IN THE SPECIFIED FILELOCATION.
