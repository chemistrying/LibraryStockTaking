# libraryStockTaking

## Features of the Program:  
* Provides formatting to input to reduce inputting time
* Saves inputs to specific file locations
* Allows deletion of inputs and undo deletions
* Counts the number of books in a file
* Clear guides
* Checks inputs using a booklist exported from the library system  
  
## Future Plans:
* Parse the booklist exported by the library system (Implemented)
* Implement a configuration system (Implemented)
* Use C# to implement the program (Implemented)

* ~~Implement a login system to have a clearer record (Will be implemented in v2)~~ (Substituted by discord API)
* ~~Add some basic GUI using Win32 API (Wait until main function of the program is implemented)~~ (Cancelled)

* Use .NET to create fancier GUI (Will not implement shortly)
* Put further arguments (e.g: -y) in front of values instead of behind it (Will be implemented later) 
* Use discord API to create a more manageable stock taking system
