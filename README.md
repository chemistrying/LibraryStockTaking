# libraryInventoryCheck

## Features of the Program:  

* Provides formatting to input to reduce inputting time
* Saves inputs to specific file location
* Allows deletion of inputs and undo deletions
* Counts the number of books in a file
* Clear guides
* Checks inputs using a booklist exported from the library system  
  
  
## Future Plans:

* Parse the booklist exported from the library system (Finished)
* Implement a configuration system (In progress)
* Implement a login system to have a clearer record (In progress)
* Add some basic GUI using Win32 API (Wait until the main function of the program is implemented)
* Use C# to implement the program (Will not implement shortly) (Considering)
* Use .NET to create fancier GUI (Will not implement shortly) (Considering)
* Use Python3 to implement the program (Considering as Python3 runtime will be significantly larger than C++/C#)
* Use tkinter to create fancier GUI (Considering)

## Curent Issues:

* Delete function not working
