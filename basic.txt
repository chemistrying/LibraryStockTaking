-----Basic Commands-----
    {input}                 Inputs data to the system. 
                            Note: It will not be immediately flushed to the target file.
    ;{format}               Changes the format of the data.
                            Leaving {format} blank equals no format. 
                            For exmaple: ;C10 will automatically add "C10" in front of the input.
                            Adding a '*' character into the format will cause the format to be splitted.
                            For exmaple: ";3*.01" will automatically add "3" in front of the input and add ".01" after the input.
                            Using a '+' character can add characters to the format.
                            For example: You have a format of "10", command ";C+" will change the format to "C10";
                            command ";C+2*+.01" will change the format to "C102*.01".
                            Default format is "".
    :{barcode}              Ignores current format and insert the input straight to the buffer.
                            Useful when there is a weird barcode formatting in that section.
    /quit                   Exits the program.
                            Note: All characters must be capitalized.
                            NOTE: ALL UNSAVED INPUTS WILL BE ERADICATED, PLEASE SAVE BEFORE YOU EXIT THE PROGRAM.
    /help [basic|advanced]  Opens this text.
    /save [fileLocation]    Saves the input to target file location. 
                            Leaving the fileLocation blank will save to the last specified file location.
                            Default fileLocation is PLEASE_TYPE_A_FILENAME_BEFORE_YOUR_FIRST_SAVE.
                            Inputing only filename will save in current folder.
                            You may use ../ in front of the filename to save to upper directories.
                            You may also do {foldername}/{filename} to save to lower directories.
                            You may also specify the exact file location.
                            Note: It is recommended to experiment these stuff by yourself.
                            Note: You don't have to input .txt when saving.
                            NOTE: SAVE COMMAND CANNOT BE UNDONE. PLEASE CONFIRM TWICE TO SEE IF YOU FILENAME IS CORRECT.
    /del [integer]          Deletes input.
                            Leaving integer blank will automatically delete last input.
                            Negative integers will delete nth last input.
                            Positive integers will delete last n inputs.
                            Supports undo command.
                            Note: Flushed inputs (or saved inputs) is irrecoverable.
                            NOTE: INPUTING AN INTEGER LARGER THAN THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS IN THE SYSTEM WILL CAUSE ERROR, AND UNEXPECTED ERRORS MAY OCCUR.

                            Only support undoing delete function.

    /count [fileLocation]   Counts the number of inputs in the file.
                            You don't have to type ".txt" at the back of the filename.
    /check [filelocation]   Checks if the input in the specified file is valid in a pre-defined booklist.
